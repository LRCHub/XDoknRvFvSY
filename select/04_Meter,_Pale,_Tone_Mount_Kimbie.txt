How can you see me bare
In the dead of night
In a cooling light
It's not a painful sight
See, girl, I couldn't see your eyes
They were coated not devoted to no one
At least no souls from beneath the sun
See me, I don't exist, you've won
See me, I don't exist, what's done is done

Now if I see you there
On the other side
Tell me, girl, has it just arrived
You saw two brains claim to coincide
If one would stay and crane the other one should die
No one could understand
If this depletes a man
To see through the cracks that brand
I'll set this weak bridge on fire
So you can piece together to admire
The infrastructure, the plunder
Deep beneath the mood
Now she lays here to resume
The days are spent in gloom
Left solely to consume

The infrastructure that sucked her
Deep beneath the ground
Now let this peaceful drown
This thinly woven crown
Krakatoa was the loudest of sounds

This tone, this tone is still alone
It roams the land
To face the hands
That stroke and stretch
Our hope is bland
You mourn this plan
This stone of sand
Built all that stands
An open curse in my hand
Smoking stands

...on the edge
But do you pledge?
What's in store?
The exposure of the car?

I start to soar
And sweep beneath the boon
Now days are spent in gloom
Who you?
My mother, I love her
I'm not connected to
This guy anymore
The sky and floor
And he could impact these facts
But they're not quite exact
As they're laid bare
A thousand-mile stare
It was the face of cement looking wet
The discontent has never meant anything
But this intent was menacing
The scent of adrenaline
Spark creditors and terrain

My bones, these wounds they roam
These rules, the road
I hope this road
I hope this road takes me as far from here as I can go
