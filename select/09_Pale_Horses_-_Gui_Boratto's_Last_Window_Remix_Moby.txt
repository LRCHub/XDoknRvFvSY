Put me on the train
Send me back my home
Couldn't leave without you
When I tried to roam

Put me by the windows
Let me see outside
Look at all the places
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died

Leave me by the churchyard
Leave me on my own
Some will come and take me
Back to my old home

Put me by the windows
Let me see outside
Look at all the places
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
